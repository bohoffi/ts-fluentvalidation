The goal of this repository is to bring a similarly good DX and usability than FluentValidation does in .NET to TypeScript by providing the abiolity to build strongly-typed and human-readable validators without any further dependencies while focussing on reusability and extensibility.

## Installation / Usage

Please refer to the official [documentation](https://bohoffi.github.io/ts-fluentvalidation/) which covers everything from installation over creating/extending validators to testing.
